## I made a Mutoscope digital.

This was one of my first projects.

I accepted the job not knowing exactly how I would complete the task but knowing I could. 

I got started first learing what a Raspberry Pi was. Starting to learn what linux and raspbian was. 

I jumped into Python and the GPIO header and what I could control with some simple code. 

I started with a program to read a hall effect sensor and blink an LED when triggered. 

Next I integrated a simple counter to measure revs/min.

Then came the fun part....

Starting the video...

Starting the video was easy. 

Stopping the video and an endless recursion of videos was not.

## Functionality

The Mutoscope Display is not an original.

It was made as a clone and fitted with a Raspberry Pi and screen to show a video highlighting history of flight.
