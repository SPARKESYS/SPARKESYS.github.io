## This Robot was better at chess than me

This project was started from a course "Hardware and software Integration" where we learned the use of C# and windows forms programs to communicate over a serial interface.


GUI had never been so easy. With Visual Studio I was able to drag and drop icons, buttons, and sliders with ease. 

Programming the backend was easy as well. 

I was given this project by the professor to "see if I could make it move by the end of the semester".

In two weeks I had a program interface where I could select the chess piece on the screen and select the position I would like to have it moved to.

This program did not include a chess engine. This was strictly hardware control.
