## Building an Underwater Robotic Observation Vehicle

This project was my final capstone project for my dual degree at the University of West Florida. 

We had 2 semesters to complete the project with proper documentation and have a functional prototype.

Our team included 2 mechanical engineering students Brandon and Gabriella. 

Starting into our first semester the design ideas flew out fast and we settled on a design that was going to include 3 thruster motors.

This design looked sleek and refined however would require a completly 3d printed shell. 

This was going to be a problem, for a few reasons.

1. We did not have a printer large enough.

2. The time it would take to print would not afford us any mistakes.

3. The space inside was too small.

Thus, our next design.
